# Git rules

For git commit messages follow the [Conventional Commits](mdc:https:/www.conventionalcommits.org) specification.

DO NOT combine `fix` and `feat` commit types with other known types like `docs` or `test` (e.g. use `docs:` instead of `feat(docs):`).

You MUST analyze every changed file with `git diff` to create descriptive commit message with proper header and optional body.

For git tags follow [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](mdc:https:/semver.org).
